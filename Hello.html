<h3>Hello Classmates!</h3>
<p>Hi everyone, this was a fun exercise. Since I live in a suburb to the north of Detroit called Royal Oak, I thought I'd include a few fun facts about the Detroit area.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Detroit is the oldest city west of the original thirteen colonies on this side of the Missippi River</li>
    <li>Detroit was the first city to assign individual telephone numbers, before this people had to share use of a party line!</li>
    <li>In 1909 the first mile of concrete highway was constructed along Woodward Avenue, between 6 and 7 mile Roads</li>
</ol>

<p>A few more fun facts</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Detroit Lions are unarguably one of the absolute worst professional football teams of all time</li>
    <li>The Red Wings, on the other hand, have been one of the better Hockey teams, having won more than a few Stanley Cups</li>
    <li>Unfortuinately we don't have any good soccer teams!</li>
</ul>
